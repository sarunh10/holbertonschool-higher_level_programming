RESTful API

0 - Basics of HTTP/HTTPS
Background: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It allows web clients (like browsers) to communicate with web servers. HTTP has evolved over time and has a secure counterpart called HTTPS (HTTP Secure). HTTPS is just like HTTP but with an added layer of security using SSL/TLS encryption. This layer protects the data from eavesdroppers and tampering.

1 - Consume data from an API using command line tools (curl) mandatory Background: curl (Client URL) is a command-line tool that allows users to transfer data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more). It’s widely used for debugging, testing, and interacting with RESTful web services and APIs. By mastering curl, one can quickly prototype API requests, diagnose server issues, and more, all from the command line.

2 - Consuming and processing data from an API using Python mandatory Background: Python, due to its readability and a vast library ecosystem, is a popular choice for interacting with web services and APIs. The requests library simplifies HTTP communication and allows users to send HTTP requests using Python. Once the data is fetched, Python’s built-in libraries and tools enable effortless data manipulation and processing.

3 - Develop a simple API using Python with the http.server module mandatory Background: The http.server module in Python’s standard library provides basic classes for implementing web servers. While it’s not typically used for production applications, it’s a handy tool for building simple web servers and understanding the basics of web programming without relying on third-party libraries.

4- Develop a Simple API using Python with Flask mandatory Background: Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, which is especially popular for creating small to medium web applications and RESTful APIs. Its minimalist and modular approach makes it a great choice for beginners to delve into web development without the overhead of more complex frameworks.

5 - API Security and Authentication Techniques mandatory Background: API security is of paramount importance, especially when the API is exposed to the wider internet. There are many risks, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and denial-of-service attacks. One fundamental method of securing APIs is to use authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access certain resources.
